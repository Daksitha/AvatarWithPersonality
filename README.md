# AvataWithPersonality
This is a project we completed as part of the seminar "How To Build a Social Computer" at Saarland University, Germany.

## Angular offset ### of a joint's position: 
Walking introvert keep their arms closer to the body where as extrovert tend to move their arms slightly away from the body. 

## Amplitude ### of motion to increase and decrease the space motion spans across:
Introvert's wave motion span in a smaller space resulting lower amplitude in motion.
Extrovert's action takes larger spanning space while doing the similar action hence higher amplitude.

## Time scaling ## of selected keyframes: 
This is to make the existing motion slower. Introvert move and act slower than an Extrovert.
